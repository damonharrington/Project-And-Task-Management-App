# Project-And-Task-Management-App
This desktop-based GUI application, developed using Python and Tkinter, provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for handling these essential project management activities.

The application empowers users to create and organize tasks, specifying details such as the title, description, group affiliation, responsible team member, priority level, and deadline. Users can define multiple groups and assign members to each group, making it easier to distribute tasks based on team structure or departmental divisions. This supports a more organized workflow and helps in managing workloads effectively.


# 🗂️ Task Management GUI App

A lightweight, desktop-based task management application built using **Python** and **Tkinter**. This app helps users and small teams organize tasks, assign responsibilities, set deadlines and priorities, and visually track progress using simple graphs.

# Key functionalities include:
Task Creation: Users can quickly add new tasks by providing essential details such as the task title and a brief description. This helps in clearly defining what needs to be done and avoids ambiguity in task objectives.

Team Member Assignment: Once a task is created, it can be assigned to a specific team member selected from a predefined list. This ensures accountability and makes it easier to distribute the workload fairly among team members.

Priority and Deadline Setting: Each task can be marked with a priority level—High, Medium, or Low—enabling users to focus on what’s most urgent or important. Additionally, a deadline can be set for each task to ensure timely completion and to help manage project timelines effectively.

Dashboard View: All created tasks are displayed in a centralized dashboard. This dashboard provides a clear overview of all ongoing activities, their statuses, assigned members, deadlines, and priorities. It serves as the control center from which users can monitor progress and make adjustments.

Graphical Analytics: To provide better visibility into team workload, the application includes a bar chart that visually represents the number of tasks assigned to each team member. This feature helps in identifying overburdened individuals or underutilized resources, enabling better task reallocation and team balance. Data is stored in memory (Python lists/dictionaries), making it ideal for demonstrations or small teams without requiring a backend.
